Many cryptocurrency web apps specifically support browser extensions for managing wallets, like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), so usability is higher than for many other use cases.

As long as the browser extension is itself suitably sandboxed (e.g., restricted to a specific [browsing profile](/solutions/browser.md#browser-profiles)), this can be a quite secure choiceâ€”the main risk being data at rest on the machine.
