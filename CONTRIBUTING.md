This guide is primarily an attempt to evangelize sandboxing and share some of my personal recommendations/opinions on the matter; however, I would love any and all contributions:

* Correcting me on matters of fact
* Suggesting additional [sandboxing solutions](solutions/) that I haven't thought of
* Suggesting how to sandbox [applications](apps/) or [use cases](use-cases/) that I haven't listed here

Just please keep in mind that this is not meant to be an authoritative referenceâ€”as such, I may decline changes that I personally disagree with (on matters of opinion).
