## Windows

_Recommendation:_ [**install native app (no sandbox)**](/solutions/install-native-app-no-sandbox.md)

Unfortunately, the "[separate user account](/solutions/install-under-separate-user.md)" solution doesn't really work on Windows, because Steam will always request administrative privileges to install itself and all games.

But the games themselves could still be run under a separate user account, if you so choose.
