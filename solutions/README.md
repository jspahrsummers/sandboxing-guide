# Sandboxing solutions

This folder lists some possible solutions for sandboxing applications generally.

I've annotated the solutions with how secure and how usable _I_ perceive each to be, overall. **These annotations are just my opinion, and certainly not authoritative!** I'm not responsible for any negative consequences you suffer if you make security decisions on this basis.

To see a visual representation of (some of) the solutions here, see ["balancing usability and scalability."](/README.md#balancing-security-and-usability)
