# Use platform-provided app

I consider this approximately equivalent to [installing from the platform app store](install-from-app-store.md).

Built-in apps are rarely as good as third-party replacements, but they receive more attention and vetting (if not by their developers, by the world at large), so it's sort of a wash.
